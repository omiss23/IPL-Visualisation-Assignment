# IPL-Visualisation-Assignment

This repository contains a Tableau dashboard of IPL statistics, built using data from matches.csv and deliveries.csv. The dashboard includes visualizations of match, player, and team statistics, with insights presented in a PPT.

This project involves creating an interactive dashboard in Tableau to showcase the important statistics of the Indian Premier League (IPL) over the years since its inception in 2008. The data is sourced from two CSV files - matches.csv and deliveries.csv - containing match-level and ball-by-ball information respectively.

The dashboard is broken down into three categories - Match Statistics, Player Statistics, and Team Statistics. Each category has sub-categories with different visualizations as mentioned below:

1. Match Statistics

- Toss outcome vs Match outcome (for each Ground/Venue)
- Biggest wins (by runs and by wicket)
- Highest totals (across all the seasons)
2. Player Statistics

- Orange Cap contenders (The batsmen who have scored the maximum number of runs in a particular season)
- Purple Cap contenders (The bowlers who have taken the maximum number of wickets in a particular season)
- Batsmen who have hit the most number of fours and sixes (per season and overall)
3. Team Statistics

- Season-wise team performance (wins vs losses)
- Win %age (home vs away)

## Files Included
The following files are included in this project:

1. **'matches.csv'** - Contains match-level information for each and every match held in IPL from 2008 to 2017.
2. **'deliveries.csv'** - Contains ball-by-ball information for each of the matches.
3. **'IPL_Statistics_Dashboard.twbx'** - Tableau workbook containing three dashboards with the visualizations for the different sub-categories of Match Statistics, Player Statistics, and Team Statistics.
4. **'IPL_Statistics_Dashboard.pptx'** - PowerPoint file containing a summary of the entire visual analysis for this project with the necessary insights and details.

## Instructions to Run the Project

## Conclusion
This project showcases how Tableau can be used to build interactive dashboards for visualizing and analyzing large datasets. The IPL statistics dashboard provides insights into the performance of players, teams, and venues over the years and can be used by sports enthusiasts, media personnel, and other stakeholders to gain valuable insights.
